# TODO

#### Note
This document is purposely being kept off Github issues to create distinction between actual in progress features and "plans for the future" which is effectively what this. It also makes it easier to throw plans onto this doc during development as new requirements are found

If the project ever garners multiple contributors this can be migrated to Github issues

- Embedded `dlltool` binary or equivalent script for Windows builds
- `clang-format`
- Profiling
    - Frequency profiling (how often something happens)
    - Framed profiling (how much of a timeframe is spent where)
- generator (editor)
    - Visual build tool
- genesis run tree func
- Build system module examples
