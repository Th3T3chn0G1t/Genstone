# Documentation

Genesis uses Javadoc-style docstrings to document functions, variables outside of functions, macros, structures and structure members. You can view these directly in the sources (variables and functions) and headers (structures macros and structure members), use Doxygen to generate local docs (Use `build/docs/Doxyfile`), or view the latest documentation build on Github pages (Recommended).
