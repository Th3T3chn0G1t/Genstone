## Reporting a Vulnerability

Genstone handles security vulnerabilities through GitHub issues. [A template is available for security bugs](https://github.com/Th3T3chn0G1t/Genstone/issues/new?assignees=Th3T3chn0G1t&labels=bug%2C+security&template=security.md&title=%5BVULNERABILITY%5D).

Once you have reported a bug, we will review it and add comments to the issue regarding our approach to the issue. If the issue is severe enough a security advisory may be created for the bug until it is patched.
In the cases of more minor vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities where no specific angle of attack is known, the issue will remain the site of discussion until resolved.
